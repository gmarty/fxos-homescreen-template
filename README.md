## Things you'll want to work on

This app is very minimal, but it's a good starter for developers looking to
build home screens for Firefox OS.

To make it really usable, you should consider adding the following features:

* Save icons order and reorder via drag and drop
* Remove icons from the home screens
* Edit pinned items details
* Migrate users details from the default home screen, if relevant to yours
* Respond to a tap on the home button
* Accessibility
* Optimisation (caching resources...)
* Localisation
